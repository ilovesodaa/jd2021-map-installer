# Known Gaps and Remaining Work

**Last Updated:** April 2026 | **Applies to:** JD2021 Map Installer v2

This document describes known limitations, unresolved issues, and potential improvements identified through code analysis.

## Active Gaps

### 1. Intro AMB Is Temporarily Disabled/Constrained

**Status:** Temporary mitigation in active use; behavior is intentionally limited.

V2 currently applies an emergency AMB policy to avoid unstable intro behavior. In practical terms, intro AMB attempts are not currently reliable and users should expect silent intro placeholders in many cases.

**Impact:**
- AMB intro output does not currently represent a fully restored parity path.
- Mid-song AMB assets remain unavailable from JDU-hosted sources.
- Existing AMB extraction/wrapper infrastructure still matters, but final audible intro behavior is currently constrained by policy.

**Operator guidance:** Document and communicate this as expected behavior, not a per-map install failure.

### 2. IPK Video Offset Is Approximate

**Status:** Inherent limitation; cannot be fully resolved from available source metadata.

Xbox 360 binary CKDs store `videoStartTime = 0.0`. The pipeline synthesizes a default from musictrack markers: `-(markers[abs(startBeat)] / 48.0 / 1000.0)`. This accounts for audio preroll but not video lead-in (extra video frames before audio starts).

Video lead-in varies per map (0s for TGIF, about 1.7s for Koi, about 1.2s for MrBlueSky) and is not encoded in binary metadata.

**Mitigation:** The GUI enables VIDEO_OFFSET handling for IPK workflows and warns that manual adjustment is expected. The marker-based formula gets users close, then manual tuning finalizes sync.

### 3. NX Platform Mode for Joycons Is Incomplete

**Status:** Partially implemented infrastructure, needs completion.

**What exists:**
- NX scene archives are downloaded and extracted.
- NX platform move folders are copied to `Timeline/Moves/NX/`.
- Scene archive selection includes NX in preference order.

**What is missing:**
- NX `.gesture` files are extracted but not merged into a usable final location.
- Maps are registered in `SkuScene_Maps_PC_All.isc`, not in `SkuScene_Maps_NX_All.isc`.
- No user-facing preference/flag to explicitly opt into NX mode.

### 4. Mid-Song AMB Sounds Remain Silent

**Status:** By design.

AMB sounds with `SoundSetClip StartTime > 0` are kept as silent WAV placeholders when real audio is hosted remotely and cannot be fetched.

For IPK maps, embedded AMB WAV CKDs are still extracted when present. Orphan WAV CKDs receive synthetic wrappers. This improves structural completeness but does not remove the source-audio availability constraint.

### 5. No Multi-Audio-Track Support

**Status:** Known limitation.

Maps with more than one audio stream (for example alternate language tracks) are not supported. The pipeline assumes one primary OGG/WAV stream per map.

### 6. ORBIS Gesture Format Incompatibility

**Status:** Mitigated by substitution, not fully resolved.

PlayStation (ORBIS) `.gesture` files use a binary format incompatible with the PC Kinect adapter. The pipeline substitutes ORBIS-exclusive gesture variants by stripping trailing digits and copying the base Kinect gesture. This works in many cases but may be inaccurate for ORBIS-exclusive choreography variants.

### 7. mapsObjectives.ilu Is Not Patched

**Status:** Not required for core playability, but may affect UI.

`mapsObjectives.ilu` ties maps to unlock conditions. The `Status = 3` override is sufficient to make maps playable, but objective-related UI behaviors may still appear for maps referenced there.

### 8. Runtime Dependency Fragility

**Status:** Operational risk.

The V2 pipeline depends on local external tooling and runtime bundles, especially:
- FFmpeg/FFprobe for media conversion/probing.
- vgmstream runtime for X360/XMA2 audio decode paths.
- Playwright Chromium runtime for Fetch workflows.

Missing or partially installed dependencies cause degraded paths, fallback behavior, or outright feature failure (especially Fetch, preview/decode, and some conversion steps).

## Potential Improvements

These are not bugs or active blockers, but improvements identified through code analysis and operations feedback:

### Parallel Downloads
The current downloader is intentionally conservative (sequential with inter-request delay). Controlled parallelism could reduce batch install time while keeping CDN-safe retry/backoff behavior.

### Progress Reporting for Downloads
Large media downloads can take several minutes without byte-level progress feedback. Adding streamed progress reporting would improve operator confidence.

### Cleanup Automation Parity
The GUI offers cleanup prompts after "Apply & Finish". Equivalent cleanup options in CLI-oriented flows would improve consistency.

### Video Lead-In Estimation for IPK Maps
Investigate ffprobe/keyframe or scene-analysis heuristics to estimate video lead-in automatically and reduce manual VIDEO_OFFSET tuning.

### AMB Policy Recovery Plan
Define and validate a staged re-enable strategy for intro AMB behavior (parity checks, regression maps, and fallback rules) before removing the temporary mitigation policy.

## Resolved Items

The following items from the original findings have been implemented in the codebase:

### Status Override for JD2021 Maps (Resolved)

**Original issue:** Maps originally from JD2021 appeared locked (`Status = 12`, ObjectiveLocked).

**Resolution:** `installers/game_writer.py` now overrides `Status = 12` to `Status = 3` (Available) during SongDesc generation.

### Download Throttling / Rate Limiting (Resolved)

**Original issue:** No protection against CDN throttling.

**Resolution:** `extractors/web_playwright.py` now implements browser-like User-Agent, retry logic with exponential backoff, HTTP 429 handling, and inter-request delay.

### Binary CKD Parsing (Resolved)

**Original issue:** Legacy Xbox 360 and older UbiArt CKD files used a cooked binary format unreadable by the JSON-based pipeline.

**Resolution:** `binary_ckd_parser.py` parses binary (big-endian) CKD files for musictracks, songdescs, choreography/karaoke tapes, cinematic tapes, autodance templates, and sound components. `helpers.load_ckd_json()` falls back to this parser when JSON parsing fails, making binary CKD support transparent throughout the pipeline.

### X360 Texture Decoding (Resolved)

**Original issue:** Xbox 360 textures used tiled memory layout and byte-swapped pixels, appearing garbled when extracted.

**Resolution:** The CKD texture decoder now detects X360 texture payloads (52-byte GPU descriptor), performs 16-bit word byte-swap, and applies Xenia-derived tiled-to-linear conversion (Tiled2D algorithm) for DXT1/DXT3/DXT5 block-compressed formats.

### Orphan AMB WAV CKD Handling (Resolved, but currently masked)

**Original issue:** Some IPK maps (e.g., Koi) contained `amb_*_intro.wav.ckd` files without matching `amb_*_intro.tpl.ckd` templates, causing AMB audio to be silently skipped.

**Resolution:** Step 09 (`step_09_process_amb`) detects orphan WAV CKDs and generates synthetic TPL and ILU wrappers.

**Current V2 note:** Intro AMB playback is currently under temporary mitigation policy (see Active Gap #1). The orphan wrapper fix remains correct infrastructure, but expected audible intro behavior is currently constrained by that policy.

### Karaoke Binary Field Order (Resolved)

**Original issue:** Binary CKD karaoke entries (entry class 80) had fields read in the wrong order, causing each syllable to appear on its own line.

**Resolution:** `binary_ckd_parser.py` now reads class 80 fields correctly: `IsEndOfLine`, `ContentType`, `StartTimeTolerance`, `EndTimeTolerance`, `SemitoneTolerance`.

### Autodance Video Structure (Resolved)

**Original issue:** Autodance stub wrote empty `video_structure = {}`, causing game assertion: "no valid video structure for song".

**Resolution:** `installers/game_writer.py` now generates a minimal valid `JD_AutodanceVideoStructure` with all required fields.
