# JD2021 Map Installer v2

> **Extract, build, and install Just Dance maps into Just Dance 2021 PC — from any source.**

![Screenshot](./assets/images/tool-screenshot.png)

A Windows-first desktop application built on **PyQt6** that turns raw map assets — whether scraped from the web, unpacked from Xbox 360 IPK archives, or extracted from **Just Dance Next** Unity bundles — into fully playable JD2021 PC maps.  
No manual file wrangling required.

---

## ✨ Headline Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎨 **Modern PyQt6 Interface** | Dark-themed, split-panel GUI with live log output, a granular progress checklist, real-time preview, and sync-refinement tools — all on background threads so the UI never freezes. |
| 🆕 **JDNext Support** | Full pipeline for Just Dance Next maps: fetch asset pages, extract Unity bundles via AssetStudioMod, parse `.btape` text files, and convert everything to UbiArt format. |
| 🔄 **Unified Pipeline** | Every source flows through the same **Extract → Normalize → Install** pipeline, producing a canonical `NormalizedMapData` regardless of origin. |
| 📦 **Multi-Mode Ingestion** | Seven distinct input modes cover every acquisition workflow — from one-click codename fetch to granular manual file selection. |
| 🎬 **Media Processing** | Automatic video transcoding (8 quality tiers with fallback), audio conversion, XMA2 decode via vgmstream, preview generation, and image format conversion powered by FFmpeg, FFprobe, and Pillow. |

---

## 🎮 Supported Modes

| Mode | Source | What It Does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Fetch (Codename)** | JDU via Playwright | Enter codenames → headless Chromium scrapes JDHelper for asset & NOHUD HTML, downloads everything, and installs automatically. |
| **HTML Files** | Saved `.html` exports | Load pre-saved asset + NOHUD HTML files from JDHelper. Useful when files are already downloaded. |
| **IPK Archive** | `.ipk` file | Extracts maps from Xbox 360 IPK archives with zlib/LZMA decompression and binary CKD parsing. |
| **Batch (Directory)** | Folder of maps | Point to a directory containing any mix of IPK files, HTML exports, or pre-extracted map folders — processes them all in sequence. |
| **Manual (Directory)** | Pre-extracted files | Full granular control: pick individual audio, video, tape, and asset files by hand. Supports JDU, IPK, and mixed source layouts. |
| **Fetch JDNext** | JDNext via Playwright | Enter codenames → fetches JDNext asset pages, extracts Unity bundles,  and converts to UbiArt. |
| **HTML Files JDNext** | Saved JDNext `.html` | Same as Fetch JDNext but from pre-saved HTML. |

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Python 3.10+** with `pip`
- **Git** (for first-time setup dependency cloning)
- **Internet connection** (for Fetch modes and first-time tool downloads)

> FFmpeg, vgmstream, Playwright Chromium, and AssetStudioModCLI are all installed automatically by `setup.bat`. You can also install them manually — see [Third-Party Tools](docs/04_reference/THIRD_PARTY_TOOLS.md).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VenB304/jd2021-map-installer.git
cd jd2021-map-installer

# 2. First-time setup — installs Python deps, Playwright, and third-party tools
setup.bat

# 3. Launch the installer
RUN.bat
```

That's it. The GUI opens, pick a mode, and start installing maps.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **JD2021 PC only** — installed maps target the PC development build and are not compatible with console versions.
- **IPK video offset is approximate** — Xbox 360 binary CKDs store `videoStartTime = 0.0`; the pipeline synthesizes a default from musictrack markers, but manual sync tuning may be needed.
- **JDNext extraction relies on third-party staging** — requires AssetStudioModCLI under `tools/`; `setup.bat` handles this automatically.
- **JDHelper links expire quickly** — HTML mode files must be used within ~30 minutes of export from the JDHelper Discord bot. If files are already downloaded, ignore this warning.
- **Toolchain completeness affects fidelity** — missing FFmpeg/FFprobe or vgmstream will degrade media conversion, previews, and fallback paths.
