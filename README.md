# JD2021 Map Installer v2

![Screenshot](./assets/images/tool-screenshot.png)
A Windows-first, pure Python GUI application built on **PyQt6** for extracting, building, and installing Just Dance maps into Just Dance 2021 PC. Supports multi-mode ingestion: codename fetch, HTML exports, IPK archives, batch installs, and manual source folders.

## Current Behavior Notes (Important)

- **Intro AMB is temporarily disabled** — the current pipeline intentionally forces silent intro placeholder behavior as a mitigation while AMB reliability is being redesigned.
- **IPK video offset remains approximate** — Xbox 360 binary CKDs do not reliably preserve lead-in timing. Manual sync tuning is expected for many IPK installs.
- **External tools are required for full fidelity** — FFmpeg/FFprobe and vgmstream availability directly affects media decode, conversion, and preview behavior.
- **JDNext support is still in active integration** — current JDNext extraction relies on third-party toolchain assets under `tools/`.

## Features

- **PyQt6 Dark-Themed GUI** — Modern split-panel interface with live log output, progress bar, and status bar. All heavy work runs on background `QThread` workers so the UI never freezes.
- **Headless Playwright Integration** — Replaces the legacy Node.js scraper. Uses `playwright-python` to fetch JDU asset pages via headless Chromium, or processes pre-saved HTML files.
- **QThread Concurrent Processing** — Extraction, normalization, and installation run in dedicated `QObject` workers that communicate with the main window exclusively through Qt signals (`progress`, `status`, `error`, `finished`).
- **Typed Data Pipeline** — The Extract → Normalize → Install pipeline produces a single canonical `NormalizedMapData` dataclass regardless of source format (web or IPK).
- **Multi-Mode Input Workflows** — Fetch by codename, HTML mode, IPK mode, batch directory mode, and manual source mode are supported in the same UI.
- **Pydantic Configuration** — All application settings (paths, quality tiers, timeouts, engine constants) are managed through a validated `AppConfig` model with environment variable support.
- **Full Binary CKD Parser** — Stateless parser for legacy binary (cooked) CKD files: musictracks, songdescs, choreography / karaoke tapes, cinematic tapes, autodance templates, and sound components.
- **IPK Archive Support** — Extracts maps from Xbox 360 `.ipk` archives with zlib / lzma decompression and path-traversal protection.
- **Video Quality Selection** — Choose from 8 quality tiers (Ultra HD down to Low) with automatic fallback.
- **Media Processing** — FFmpeg / FFprobe / Pillow wrappers for video transcoding, audio conversion, preview generation, and image format conversion.
- **Readjust & Batch Offset Tools** — Post-install sync refinement supports per-map and multi-map offset adjustment workflows.

## Module Overview

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `core/` | Data models (`NormalizedMapData`, tapes, clips), Pydantic `AppConfig`, and typed exception hierarchy |
| `extractors/` | `BaseExtractor` ABC, `WebPlaywrightExtractor` (HTML + live scraping), `ArchiveIPKExtractor` (IPK archives) |
| `parsers/` | `normalizer` (raw files → `NormalizedMapData`), `binary_ckd` (stateless binary CKD parser) |
| `installers/` | `game_writer` (UbiArt `.trk/.tpl/.act/.isc` generation), `media_processor` (FFmpeg / FFprobe / Pillow / vgmstream-dependent paths) |
| `ui/` | `MainWindow` (PyQt6), `workers/pipeline_workers.py` (QThread-based workers) |

## Quick Start

See **[Getting Started](docs/01_getting_started/GETTING_STARTED.md)** for the full setup walkthrough and how to start without these batch scripts.

```bash
# 1. First-time setup (installs Python deps and tool prerequisites)
setup.bat

# 2. Run the installer app
RUN.bat

```

## Limitations

- **JD2021 PC only** — maps installed by this pipeline target the PC development build and are not compatible with console versions.
- **IPK video offset is approximate** — Xbox 360 binary CKDs store `videoStartTime = 0.0`. The pipeline synthesizes a reasonable default from musictrack markers, but manual adjustment may be required.
- **Intro AMB generation is intentionally disabled right now** — the current build forces silent intro placeholder behavior while AMB processing is under active reliability rework.
- **Some background AMB sounds remain silent** — mid-song AMB sounds hosted only on JDU servers cannot be downloaded in all cases.
- **JDHelper required for HTML modes** — asset Fetch/HTML mode files must be exported from the JDHelper Discord bot. Links expire quickly after the bot responds.
- **Toolchain completeness affects results** — missing FFmpeg/FFprobe or vgmstream can degrade decode/conversion paths, previews, and fallback behavior.
- **JDNext mapPackage extraction depends on local third-party tool staging** — if `AssetStudioModCLI.exe` is missing under `tools`, JDNext extraction may fail or fall back to reduced coverage.
